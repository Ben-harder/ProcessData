### Author: Ben Harder, 2018

## Description

This application will combine a directory of comma delimited data. The combined data can be found in the specified output directory. The program was designed to not accept **mismatched headers** and so a file documenting which files were mismatched, if there were any, will also be created in the output directory.

## Instructions

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter a source path.
3. Enter a output path.
4. Enter output file name.
5. Click 'process'.
6. Open Excel.
7. Open the insert data dialog.
8. Navigate to the directory you specified as the output path and select the output file.
9. Insert the data.
